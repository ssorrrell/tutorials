Part 1 - back-end with ASP.NET Core 2.2 and Entity Framework Core

Let’s take a look at how to build a CRUD web app using ASP.NET Core 2.2, Entity Framework Core, and Angular 8. This is part 1 where we focus on the back-end.

Part 2 is here - Angular 8 app with REST API

We’ll have a REST API in the back-end and the Angular app on the front-end.

The basic CRUD app will be a blog, where we can Create, Read, Update, and Delete blog posts.
