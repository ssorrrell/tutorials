This tutorial teaches the basics of building a web API with ASP.NET Core.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

    Create a web API project.
    Add a model class and a database context.
    Scaffold a controller with CRUD methods.
    Configure routing, URL paths, and return values.
    Call the web API with Postman.

At the end, you have a web API that can manage "to-do" items stored in a database.
